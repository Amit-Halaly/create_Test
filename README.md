# Student Q&A System
# Project Overview
This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application developed in Java. It is designed to create and manage questions and answers for students across various subjects. The program allows for the creation of custom question sets according to specific educational requirements, making it a versatile tool for educators.

# Features
Subject Management: Create and manage subjects, each with its own set of questions.
Question Creation: Define questions with various types, including multiple choice, true/false, and short answer.
Answer Management: Attach correct answers to each question and handle multiple possible answers where applicable.
Customizable Requirements: Tailor question sets based on specific criteria, such as difficulty level, topic, or format.
Student Interaction: Provide a way for students to answer questions and receive feedback based on their responses.
Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
OOP Principles: The application is built following core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Data Structures: Utilizes Java collections for managing and organizing questions and answers efficiently.
